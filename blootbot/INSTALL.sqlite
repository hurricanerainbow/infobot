INSTALL.sqlite
----------------

SQLite is a C library that implements an embeddable SQL database engine.
Programs that link with the SQLite library can have SQL database access without
running a separate RDBMS process. The distribution comes with a standalone
command-line access program (sqlite) that can be used to administer an SQLite
database and which serves as an example of how to use the SQLite library.

blootbot will create a file called <DBname>.sqlite and populate the tables for
you if they do not already exist.

- Install SQLite libraries and DBI Perl modules.
	- Debian: (apt-get install libsqlite0 libdbd-sqlite-perl)

other distros might need to build from sources.

SQLite sources:

http://www.hwaci.com/sw/sqlite/ 

DBD::SQLite sources:

http://search.cpan.org/author/MSERGEANT/DBD-SQLite/

You will also need the normal Perl DBD stuff which
should be included in your Perl distribution.
