TODO:
	- let's get a release out!
	- kill SHM and and move to a pipe
	- move nicks/server into sql table
	- make channel flags be server/channel flags
	- move channel flags to sql table, include initial state
	- move praise from blootbot.lang to "praise:<something>" in factoids?
	- move lart from blootbot.lang to "lart:<something>" in factoids?
	- add handling for channel specific factoids:
	  "#botpark logs" -> http://ibot.rikers.org/botpark
	- all IsChanConf tests MUST be checking for >0 as -1 is possible
	  there are a lot of incorrect "if(IsChanConf("foo")) instances now
	- move src/modules.pl to a built list from src/Modules/*
	  refresh this list on start and reload. note: lowercase and strip .pl
	- make sure scheduler design is _right_ - it's broken'ish.
	- debian BTS frontend "bugs"
	- !country
	- !dinstall
	- support DCC SEND of factoid (listkeys/listvals) that matched.
	- news: show total requested count, users "registered", users
	  "ignored"
	- add notes about news redesign to accomodate individual items
	  read - need to add id's to each item too.
	- bind DCC CHAT service to port.
		- man perlipc, search for service.
		- do forking aswell.
	- debian: "find -2.4.1" does not work but 2.4.1 does?
		- $debug var needed.
	- check if debian downloading files are proper.
	- verbose: say why config option was enabled/enabled.
	- registered flags for users/channels
		- end of DynaConfig.pl
		- use in UserDCC.. warn if value is not in list.
		- add &checkSet() or &_chanset();
	- attempt to move userDCC to hooks.
		- need to modify parseCmdHooks for user flags?
	- make timers below 5 or 10 mins non-random values.
	- create a .csv import/export program
-- EFFORT 1.
	- make IRC/Schedulers.pl work 100%.
		- intervals must be multiple of the smallest one
			- otherwise auto-fixed.
		- make intervals chan-specific
			- need to store info in $sched{$what}{$chan} =
			time(); when last run or next run?
----------------------------------------------------
------------ FUTURE, NON-IMPORTANT
	- <greycat> ~country ua
	- <irq_w> xk: add it :) and my imdb feature :)
	- <greycat> xk: and ~bugs :)
	- "HACKING" text file, documentation of where things start,
	  what "core" or reuseable functions are used and what for.
	- web interface
	- on join message - customizeable, option.
		- addon to UserInfo but for channels?
	- ^B's are removed (HOW?) from factoids.
	- asking questions.... make more guesses
	- throttling of "help topic": push-pull system of &msg().
	- use autoloader properly.
		- Module::<BLAH>::<CMD>
		- make a global autoloader.
	- support notification of author of deleted factoids,
	- flag to hide owner of factoid.
	- table data for DCC CHAT or misc table.
	- dynamic user//configuration file upgrade:
		- finer granuality(sp) of userlist/ignore file
	- <el_gore> apt, find netconfig -- merge similar files.
		- and same files(1 per package) for multiple packages.
		- merge partial similar paths together.
		- do some test cases to confirm code actually works as
		  proposed.
